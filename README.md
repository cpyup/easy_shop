# Easy Shop (Backend)

## Project Summary

The easy shop project is a full-stack application simulating an e-commerce site. The original project was unfinished and contained multiple bugs. I was tasked with completing the backend methods and locating existing bugs.

This repo houses the Java backend application, and the sql script required to create the initial database. The frontend code to interact with this Java backend is located [here.](https://github.com/cpyup/easy_shop_frontend)
